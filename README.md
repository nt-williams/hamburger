# hamburger

`hamburger` began as a non-specific project to house a variety of R functions I use often throughout my work. After some thought, I have decided to discontinue any work with `hamburger` and instead split its functions into separate and more specific R packages. 

Those packages are: 
- [`tmleExtract`](https://github.com/nt-williams/tmleExtract)
- [`sas2r`](https://github.com/nt-williams/sas2r)
- [`formatix`](https://github.com/nt-williams/formatix)
